||
| **Algorithm Used:** |
| The paper employs a combination of traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning techniques for sentiment analysis on social media data. Notable algorithms include Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). |
||
| **Methodology Used:** |
| The paper proposes a custom social media platform that performs sentiment analysis on all the activities of the users in a group and creates a report according to their reactions and their posts on the platform. Every activity is rated based on the sentiments behind it on a scale of −1 and +1, 0 is a neutral sentiment. |
