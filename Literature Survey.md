| Dilesh Tanna; Manasi Dudhane; Amrut Sardar; Prof. Kiran Deshpande; Prof. Neha Deshmukh |
||
| **Year of Publication:** |
| The paper was published in the 2020 4th International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Control Systems (ICICCS) |
||
| **Algorithm Used:** |
| The paper employs a combination of traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning techniques for sentiment analysis on social media data. Notable algorithms include Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). |
||
| **Methodology Used:** |
| The paper proposes a custom social media platform that performs sentiment analysis on all the activities of the users in a group and creates a report according to their reactions and their posts on the platform. Every activity is rated based on the sentiments behind it on a scale of âˆ’1 and +1, 0 is a neutral sentiment. |
||
| **Advantages:** |
| The proposed platform can facilitate the decision-making process for the admins and also help detect any need to give special attention to any user in a group, such as a student coping up with depression. It can also be used to share content on other social media platforms. |
| **Disadvantages:** |
| Depending on the sources of social media data, biases and limitations in the dataset may impact the generalizability of the model. The use of deep learning techniques, particularly RNNs, may require substantial computational resources, limiting the scalability of the proposed model. |
